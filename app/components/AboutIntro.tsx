            <p>Navigating legal risks has always been messy, expensive, and reactive. At Lawyered, we asked a simple question: what if legal support worked like infrastructure — always on, affordable, and built into everyday life?</p>
            <p>That’s the idea behind Lawyered. We’ve created India’s first Gen AI-driven Legal Risk Management platform, starting with the mobility sector. With LOTS247 (roadside legal assistance) and ChallanPay (challan discovery and resolution), we’re already helping 600,000+ vehicles and 800+ businesses stay compliant and stress-free. Backed by a 70,000+ lawyer network, we’ve resolved more than 200,000 legal matters, saving our customers over ₹50 Cr in penalties and downtime.</p>
            <p>But our story doesn’t stop at mobility. We’re building the rails of legal infrastructure for the future — expanding into finance, real estate, healthcare, and beyond. Our vision is simple: to make law proactive, preventive, and accessible to all.</p>
