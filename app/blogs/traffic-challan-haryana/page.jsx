          <p>
            Traffic challans are not just penalties; they serve as reminders of the legal responsibilities every driver must uphold.

          <h2 className="text-white font-bold text-2xl">Common On-Road Legal Problems Related to Traffic Challans in Haryana</h2>
          <p>
            In Haryana, like many other states, traffic rules have become more stringent, especially with amendments in the Motor Vehicles Act. This means drivers are more likely to encounter challans for various infractions, such as speeding, not wearing a seatbelt, or using a mobile phone while driving. These on-road legal problems can be challenging, especially for those unfamiliar with the process of resolving them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The consequences of not paying a challan on time can be significant. Beyond financial penalties, drivers face the risk of licence suspension and vehicle blacklisting, which can severely limit mobility and lead to other legal repercussions. To address these challenges, the government has simplified the challan payment process through online portals and mobile apps, making it easier to resolve such issues efficiently.
